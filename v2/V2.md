## **Why WiggleBin?**

Composting worms, such as **Eisenia fetida** (red wigglers), are incredibly effective at breaking down organic waste into nutrient-rich compost. However, they are sensitive to temperature fluctuations, which can drastically affect their health and composting efficiency.

In cold climates like the **Netherlands**, the temperature in winter can drop below the worms' survival range. To protect the worms and maintain a healthy composting process, it is essential to keep the soil temperature stable and within an optimal range.

The **WiggleBin** solves this challenge by using **solar energy** for heating the compost bin in the winter and a **passive cooling system** to prevent overheating in the summer. It combines **thermal management**, **solar energy**, **passive insulation**, and **smart monitoring** to ensure worms stay comfortable, healthy, and productive, all while being energy efficient and sustainable. 

Placing the **WiggleBin** on your **balcony** optimizes the use of natural sunlight for both heating and cooling, while being sheltered from extreme weather conditions, creating the ideal environment for composting worms.

## **How It Works**

The **WiggleBin** project uses a combination of **solar heat collection**, **passive insulation**, **temperature regulation**, and **smart technology** to maintain an ideal environment for composting worms:

1. **Solar Heat Collection**: A **solar collector** is used to capture energy from the sun (even during the winter months when sunlight is limited). The solar collector is built from **laser-cut wood** with an **acrylic front plate** to maximize solar absorption. The collector **passively transfers** the captured heat up to the worm bin, warming the compost. **Black garden hose** is used to connect the solar collector to the worm bin for the transfer of the absorbed heat.

   **Temperature Limiting**: The solar collector is designed to ensure the temperature inside the worm bin never exceeds **50°C**. This is achieved through **size limitations** of the solar collector, the **color of the absorber** (avoiding overly dark colors that can absorb too much heat), and possibly incorporating **passive thermal limiters**. This ensures that the heat transferred to the bin stays within safe temperature ranges to prevent damage to materials and electronics.

2. **Insulated Box with Seasonal Panel Swap**: The worm bin is placed inside an **insulated box**, which is also **laser-cut** from **wood** for structural strength and precision. This box keeps a small space around the bin that can be filled with **wool**, **felt**, or **cardboard** to provide insulation. The box features a **black panel** for the winter months, helping absorb more heat during daylight hours. In summer, you can replace the black panel with a **white panel** to reflect sunlight and reduce excess heat. This simple yet effective method adjusts the solar energy absorption depending on the season, ensuring the worms stay within their ideal temperature range year-round.

3. **Temperature Regulation Using Servo Motors**: A **servo motor system** is incorporated to control ventilation and adjust the release of heat when necessary. When the temperature inside the bin exceeds a set limit, the motors open vents to allow hot air to escape, maintaining a stable internal temperature.

4. **Alternative Options**: As an alternative to servo motors, **wax-based actuators** or **bimetallic strips** could also be used for temperature regulation. These passive components automatically adjust ventilation based on temperature changes, without requiring a motor or electronics.

5. **Ventilation Control**: The **servo motor** system is controlled via sensors that monitor the temperature inside the bin. These motors will open or close ventilation flaps to regulate temperature, keeping it within the ideal range for the worms.

6. **Smart Monitoring with DS18B20 Temperature Sensors**: The temperature inside the worm bin is monitored using **DS18B20 temperature sensors** placed at multiple points inside the bin. This provides accurate readings to ensure that the worms are in their optimal temperature range. The temperature data is sent to a central system, allowing you to track the bin's environment remotely.

7. **Camera System with LED Ring**: An **ESP32-CAM** or similar camera is placed inside the bin to take hourly photos. The camera is equipped with a small **LED ring** for illumination, allowing it to capture clear images even in low-light conditions. These images are stored on an **SD card** and can be sent to the **cloud**, a **Raspberry Pi**, or another **ESP32** system inside the house for further processing.

8. **Timelapse Creation with Raspberry Pi**: The **Raspberry Pi** collects the hourly photos from the **ESP32-CAM** and creates a **timelapse video** once a day. This video is available via an **API**, allowing you to access and view it remotely. The timelapse provides a unique visual insight into how your worms are progressing over time, helping you monitor their activity and composting efficiency.

9. **Balcony Setup**: The **WiggleBin** is designed to be placed on your **balcony**, which allows the system to take full advantage of available sunlight while also being sheltered from harsh weather. The balcony setup also reduces space requirements, making it a perfect fit for homes with limited yard space.
